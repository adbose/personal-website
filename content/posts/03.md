Over the past month, I hacked around with the Twilio API for WhatsApp to create some simple bots following their documentation and tutorials.

One bot I made replies with real time Covid-19 cases when users send country names.
Although pretty basic, it's a good exercise in fetching data from somewhere on the internet, and displaying it on a chat.
We have already seen how we can import twilio to a python script to use it's APIs to send messages to users.
In this project, we would create a Flask app and use Twilio's `twiml` APIs to send meaningful information based on user queries.

#### Conclusion
I went further with this bot. Twilio was hosting a month long online hackathon on dev.to
I too sent a sumbission for a whatsapp bot that provides location based tracking of covid-19 cases from all over India.

The project is still in development, but you can test it out on whatsapp using this link.
Stay tuned for more updates on this project!
