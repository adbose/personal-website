Hello, and welcome to my blog! I am glad that you stopped by.

This site is a mainly a journal of my experiences and lessons in programming, along with some occasional opinions and writeups on technology.

You can find updates on the things I am working on [here](posts), or read more about me [here](about).

See you around!

Cheers!!

Update: I have moved to [Hashnode](https://adityabose.hashnode.dev) in 2021. I might still post some of my unpublished posts here.
